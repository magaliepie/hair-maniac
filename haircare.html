          Our hair is almost like a fingerprint - unique, different for everyone. Choosing the right care, i.e.
          the one that will give us the best results is a big challenge. So before we choose the care products,
          it is worth considering what our hair really is. This will make it easier for us to discover them
          needs and make them become our greatest decoration.

          The surface of the hair is covered with small scales made of cysteine and fatty acids
          pose
          the outer, protective layer of the hair.
          <br>
          <br>
          Porosity is the degree of deflection of these scales on the surface, it is often a genetic characteristic, but
          it also depends
          from
          the way of hair care and hairdressing treatments that we perform.
          <br>
          <br>
          Depending on the degree of the cuticles, we can distinguish three types of hair:
        </p>

        <h4> low porosity hair </h4>
        <h4> medium porosity hair </h4>
        <h4> high porosity hair </h4>

          <h2> low porosity hair </h2>
          <p>Low porosity hair has scales that sit tightly against the cortex and are arranged regularly. No
            they require such extensive care, it should be limited, because low porosity hair is very easy
            burden.
            <br> <br>
            <br>
            Such hair is resistant to damage, any hairdressing treatments, but also styling. They are hair by nature
            healthy, smooth and shiny. They arrange in a characteristic "pouring" way, slippery to the touch,
            styled have a tendency to return to their pre-styling form. It's easy to charge them with the wrong one,
            over-care and cause hair to "splash". Low porosity hair tends to release moisture
            gradually and slowly, resulting in a long drying time.
          </p>

        <div>
          <h2> medium porosity hair</h2>
          <p>Most hair naturally has a medium porosity. Often it is hair that
            high porosity
            has been reduced by proper care or the low porosity has been raised by treatments
            chemical.
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            Medium porosity hair often combines the features of high and low porosity hair, they are short for short
            ,normal'. Often it is wavy hair that is not too dry and coarse, but not as smooth as it is
            low porosity hair. They do not cause much difficulty, are amenable to styling and styling, but they are much
            less than high porosity hair. Similarly, but to a lesser extent than high porosity hair, they tend
            frizz and can be difficult to detangle.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h2>high porosity hair </h2>
          <p>High porosity hair has an irregularly distributed cuticle that stands out strongly from the hair cortex and
            It reacts very easily to changes in temperature or air humidity. This makes the hair so much more
            exposed to mechanical damage and harmful effects of substances.
            <br>
            <br>
            Such hair, if not properly handled
            we won't take care they will be dull, rough and frizzy.
            <br>
            <br>
            They are most suitable for high porosity hair
            high molecular weight proteins (milk proteins, whey proteins, silk proteins, wheat proteins and
            oatmeal), which fill the gaps in the cuticle and smooth it as their basic building material.
